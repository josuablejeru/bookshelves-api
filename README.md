# Bookshelves API

This Project goal is to be a API for all the Books, Podcasts and Shows I want to share on my personal website or any other place.

# Setup

- Create a public bookshelf in Google Books

- extract the user ID and Bookshelves ID from the ULR you see in the URL bar.
It should look like this `https://books.google.com/books?uid=<your-user-id>&as_coll=<bookshelves-id>&source=gbs_lp_bookshelf_list`
- export `USER_ID` and `BOOKSHELF_ID` to your environment
